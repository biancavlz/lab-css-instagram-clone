                        Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with friends and family. <br />
                        Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram
                        &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way
                        to see the world. <br />
                        Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
